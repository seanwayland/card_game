# card_game

A rendering of the card game "war" 
https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/

This is a flask/python API using a mysql DB. 
Front end is "pure" vanilla JS, HTML with bootstrap 

Game is hosted here : 

http://seanwayland.pythonanywhere.com

login : cardgame
password : holdem 

To do : 

Pretty UI ! 
Save Game ID into flask endpoint from javascript properly 

To watch game end and not click for DAYS :
Edit source for functions.js change function line 174 so that cards always go to player one each hand 

I think player 2 always seems to do worse! 
I tried shuffling the cards at the outset. 
Not sure how random the javascript functions are. 
Why ? 

This is the basic site files without all the flask boilerplate which was auto generated by python anywhere.
